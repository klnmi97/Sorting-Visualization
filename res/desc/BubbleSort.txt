Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the array that need to be sorted. It compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This procedure is repeated until two first elements are compared and swapped. Bubble Sort has its name because smaller elements bubble toward the top of the array.
