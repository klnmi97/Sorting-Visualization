Cocktail Sort, also known as Bidirectional Bubble Bort, Shaker Sort is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison-based sort. The algorithm differs from the Bubble Sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the array. This sorting algorithm solves the problem of "turtles" in the Bubble Sorts.
