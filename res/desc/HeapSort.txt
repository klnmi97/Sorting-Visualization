Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algortihm that uses Binary Heap data structure. Almost like in the Selection Sort we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element.
A Binary Heap is a complete binary tree where items are stored in such order that value in a parent node is greater than the values of its two children nodes. Such binary heap is called max-heap. The heap can be easily represented by array. If the parent node is stored at index i, the left child can be calculated as 2 * i + 1 and right child as 2 * i + 2. It works for the array start index 0.
