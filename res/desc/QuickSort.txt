Quick Sort utilizes 'divide and conquer' strategy.
Algorithm takes one item at unsorted array or its part, usually it is the leftmost or the rightmost element of array. Then this item, also known as pivot, is moved to its final position in the array that is should occupy. While determining pivot's position, other elements of array are rearranged the way that no bigger elements on the right and no smaller elements are on the left.
